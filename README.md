**Introduction**- Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. To effectively manage and treat PD it is crucial to have objective ways of monitoring symptoms as the disease can manifest in many  ways. The rise of devices, especially smartphones has brought about new possibilities in healthcare. In this poster we explore a question; Can we use smartphone data to measure and predict the progression of Parkinson's disease in an objective manner? By investigating the practicality of phenotyping through smartphone data collection the goal is to shed light on continuous and real time monitoring, improved diagnostics, personalized treatment approaches and early detection of relapse, in PD. 
**Objectives**- Evaluating the Viability of Collecting Smartphone Data- Assessing whether using smartphone based data collection is an effective method, for measuring symptoms related to Parkinson’s disease. Creating Advanced Models; Constructing machine learning algorithms that utilize smartphone data to make predictions, about the advancement of Parkinson's disease and its associated symptoms.
**Materials and Methods**-My goal, in this study was to make predictions about the progression of Parkinsons Disease (PD) by analyzing smartphone data from 16 participants. The dataset provided by the Michael J. Fox Foundation included sensor information. The main focus was on the accelerometer data. To process the data they extracted accelerometer details. Grouped them into one hour intervals. We also calculated eight features, for the x, y and z axis. Next I trained one classifier a  Random Forest (RF). Using this dataset. Finally I evaluated their performance by finding the test set error rate.
**Results**-The analysis showed decent results in predicting PD progression based on smartphone accelerometer data. The RF model demonstrated  84.57% accuracy, correctly identifying users with PD. The most influential features for the RF model were the xyz.mean, roll.mean, and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) at the 6Hz frequency band.
**Conclusions**-Based on the  research we have discovered that machine learning algorithms have the ability to somewhat  effectively forecast Parkinsons disease by analyzing data, from smartphone accelerometers. The random forest (RF) model provided information about the factors involved in predicting PD. This study emphasizes the significance of phenotyping and the usefulness of data collected through smartphones in evaluating the progression of diseases. These findings bring forth encouraging prospects for integrating smartphone based data into studies enhancing disease monitoring and elevating the standard of care for individuals, with PD.
